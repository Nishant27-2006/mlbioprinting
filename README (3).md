# Bioprinting Image Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing a subset of 50 bioprinted images from a dataset of 1000 images. The analysis uses machine learning techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and K-Means clustering to understand patterns and relationships between the images. The analysis is aimed at optimizing bioprinting parameters by identifying common structures and relationships between the images.

## Dataset

The `data/` folder contains a subset of bioprinted images. These images are used as input for the analysis and have been preprocessed for uniformity in size and format.

- **Image Format**: TIFF
- **Resolution**: 256x256 pixels (resized for uniformity)
- **Number of Images**: 50

## Requirements

To run the analysis, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
- scikit-image (for image preprocessing)

You can install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

The Python script `bioprinting_analysis.py` processes the image data and generates several key outputs:

1. **PCA (Principal Component Analysis)**: Reduces the dimensionality of the image data to highlight the main components of variance.
2. **K-Means Clustering**: Groups similar images into clusters based on pixel intensity distributions.
3. **Elbow Method**: Determines the optimal number of clusters by plotting the within-cluster sum of squares (inertia).

To run the script, simply execute:

```
python bioprinting_analysis.py
```

This will generate visualizations and results, including PCA projections, clustering results, and correlation heatmaps for the image data.

## Output

The following key outputs will be generated by the script:

- **Pairwise Correlation Matrix**: Shows the correlation between pixel intensity distributions of the images.
- **PCA Results**: Visualizes the principal components of the images in both 2D and 3D.
- **K-Means Clustering**: Groups images into clusters, visualized using PCA components.
- **Elbow Plot**: Displays the optimal number of clusters for K-Means.

## Future Directions

This repository provides a foundation for further work on bioprinting optimization using machine learning techniques. Future work can expand the dataset, explore advanced clustering techniques, and integrate bioprinting parameters for deeper analysis.
